title: End of second semester
---

Well as you may know I'm an engineering student at Chapingo University in Mexico. At the time I am finishing my second semester of the master degree. It has been a very exciting time and not so easy. Every engineering requires a very well understanding of math, particularly this program requires statistics and programming.

This semester I was taking classes like statistics, simulation of bio-systems, hydraulics and, a class of evolutionary and bio-inspired algorithms.

Software that was useful was Matlab (a lot), R, Mathematica and Epanet. A Voyage 200 or another Texas Instruments calculator is very useful for the statistic course.

One of my goals was to use (or at least try to) free and open source software. Until now, the only proprietary pieces software that I am using are Matlab and Mathematica, but I use them a lot. I think the Matlab-Simulink combo can be replaced easily by Scilab. There are a lot of replacements for Mathematica, but they are not as "good".
So, now on I will be focused in my research. First I have to study some evolutionary computing and select some evolutionary algorithms to use as part of my research. And that sounds exciting to me.
