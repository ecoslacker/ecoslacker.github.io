If you read previous posts in this blog you should know I'm studying my master in agricultural engineering at Chapingo University. And this first year was so thrilling!

But there was a problem for me, some professors use proprietary software in their classes. For example two of the most used programs are Matlab and Mathematica. I have to confess that I bought those programs with some guilt because I consider myself an enthusiast of the free/open source software. I used them on Linux and their performance was excellent even better than other people whom used Windows.

Those programs aren't cheap. Student license for Mathematica cost me $139 USD and Matlab 2015a Student License was $89 USD (with Simulink and 10 most used add-ons) plus an additional $25 USD for the Global Optimization Toolbox. So my final investment in software for my education last semester was $253 USD (around $4,300 MXN at that time). That is a lot for a regular student! Not everyone is willing to pay that amount of money.

Also there are another things that one have to buy for other classes, such as Arduino, sensors and electronic materials, but in this post I'm not consider that.

But there are no excuses. In Mexico, CONACyT scholarships are enough to cover those materials and programs.

The other option, is the use of Free Software. But I'm talking about individual use of the software, not institutional. The professor recommends to the student to use those programs but a student has the freedom to choose another one that fits more his/her needs.

Mathematica gave me trouble because I was unable to get the result of some calculus problems, it just kept running for a while and gave no result. Funny that other classmates with different versions were able to solve the same problem. And that was during an exam!

Well Matlab is another piece of software that becomes essential. I use a lot of Matlab and is very convenient that it has several toolboxes that make my life easier.

Those two programs can be replaced with some free software programs, but I think it needs additional work. Besides those are the programs the professors use and that is what they teach, I don't know their reasons but I believe most of them are not willing to change that.

So it's up to the student to find a free software replacement and do an extra work to learn how to do the same things.

For now I will be using those programs, until now I have done nothing about that, but the things are going to change...
