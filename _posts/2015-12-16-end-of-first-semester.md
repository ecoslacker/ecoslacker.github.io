title: End of first semester
---

In august of this year I started a new stage in my life because I enter to the <a href="http://portal.chapingo.mx/iauia/" target="_blank">agricultural engineering master program</a> at Chapingo University, and this december I'm ending the first semester. I have to say it wasn't easy.

I finished my BSc studies by 2010 and I have been working about five years. So it was difficult to start taking classes again, studying, going to the library and doing homework. I think the most difficult part was to change habits, because after work I got home and rest, now I have to go to bed so late in the night because of my homework and research topic.

<a href="http://chapingo.mx/" target="_blank">Chapingo</a> is an university that has an agricultural profile, most of its careers are related to agricultural and natural resources. There are a lot of options related to agriculture that one can choose to study, for example there are soil engineering, forestry engineering, irrigation engineering, mechanical engineering, etc. Economy or food industry are focused on the agricultural part of it. And of course the most huge departments are those related to plant/crop and animal sciences. Chapingo wants their students to be full-time students so it is a boarding school, it has dining halls, scholarships, and a lot of free services for the students.

I came from irrigation engineering and like any engineering mathematics is a very strong part of it. In the master program I had to remember a lot of forgotten concepts. And I had to sharp my skills for thinking how to solve math problems again. It was a very challenging semester!

I took four courses: Applied Mathematics for Engineering, Research Methodology, Instrumentation, and Optimization Methods. I also took Optimal Control as an unregistered student. Most of the courses you need solid math knowledge. Some logic, programming and electronics extra knowledge is very useful too. My classes were very exciting and at some point you get so busy that there is no time to do other things. No time even to write in a blog ;-)

This was a very glad experience for me because I want to get my master degree and later get my doctorate. In fact I'm looking forward to get it in another country, but I have to worry about that later.

I recommend this master program for somebody who wants an agricultural related degree, but remember this is an engineering program so expect a lot of math.
