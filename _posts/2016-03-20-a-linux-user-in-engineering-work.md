title: A Linux user in engineering work
---
As you may know by now, I am kind of a free software enthusiast and a proud Linux user. I'm an engineer and a master student. I used to make a life working in geographic information systems (GIS) related projects, hydrology, and  other stuff.

I don't know in other work fields of engineering, but at least in my experience is very difficult to be a Linux user. I mean is very difficult to work when you are in a teamwork with people that uses a lot of proprietary software.

Some specific reasons are, there aren't a lot of options to edit a DWG file from the latest version of AutoCAD or a MXD file from an ArcMap project. Some times I had trouble handling huge reports made in Microsoft Word with LibreOffice; among other stuff.

I realize, there are two possible obvious solutions for this situations. First, make the whole team to use the same document formats that I used. This implies to teach my co-workers to use the same programs that I use, those are:

<ul>
	<li><strong>LibreOffice</strong> or <strong>OpenOffice</strong> specifically to use Writer to do some documents and Spreadsheets for calculations and tables. </li>
	<li><strong>Texmaker</strong> for report editing using latex.</li>
	<li><strong>QGIS</strong> for GIS projects.</li>
	<li>Some CAD programs, in the free software side we have <strong>LibreCAD</strong> that is enough for the kind of work I did.</li>
</ul>

DWG is a very difficult format to work with Linux and is even worse if one wish to use free software, but if DWG format is required, using <strong>DraftSight</strong> was a good option for me although it's not free software. I don't do this kind of work anymore and now there seems to be more options, like LibreDWG.

Until now I have replaced Windows by Slackware Linux as my main OS, Microsoft Office by LibreOffice and Texmaker, AutoCAD by LibreCAD (or DraftSight) and ArcGIS by QGIS. Of course there are more programs that I use, but those are the big ones that I have been using in a teamwork.

Now, what about the ones that don't have a "useful" replacement like Google Maps and Google Earth. OpenStreetMap is not as good in some places, there is a lot more of information that Google Maps has. I'm not talking information about restaurants, coffee shops and bars, I am talking about routes in the mountains, pictures and good resolution satellite images of some places far away in the country. Those are the places that I was working on, and only proprietary software can provide that information (as far as I know).

Google Drive and Dropbox are other essential pieces of software for many teams where I had work. 

So with all those examples in mind, the proprietary software becomes essential even if you aren't using Windows .

I could try to "evangelize" and teach my co-workers to use those programs. This means they have to learn the basics of free format documents and use some new programs. But the problem would be if they are willing to accept them and use them. They have to change the way they do their work. As far as I think about, that is the difficult part. Well, I didn't do it so I have no answer for that.

The second solution, the one that I choose with a lot of pain in my hearth, was to use Windows and the same proprietary software as my team. I was paid to do some work, not to teach some programs to my team mates. So I just installed a Windows Virtual machine and Wine and run the programs I needed. I felt defeated by then.

So the story changed a little when I was the leader of the project, the options were a lot easier because people were assigned to work with me and I decided, among other things, what programs to use. I spend a few days to teach my team about QGIS, LibreOffice and LibreCAD. They learned the basics at the point we can work well as a team. Some of them were amazed how good some free programs are. It's well known that ArcMap and AutoCAD are big heavy programs, and programs LibreCAD and QGIS run faster in the same Windows computer. They were surprised that things could run faster because they were used to work with very slow GIS projects. And they realized that there are some perks using new programs. This time I felt victorious.

But at this time I have all the power and made all the decisions. So I realized that when I was an employee and people told me what to do, I had a difficult time adapting myself to the team with my Linux and my programs. So at the end I had to use the same programs the team had been using. But when I was the boss, I could easily say "use that program" and they had to use it. But I wasn't like that, I took the time to teach them what I wanted them to use.

So in my experience, if I want to show some engineers about free software, I need to have the authority, the knowledge and to be the teacher. Because if I teach them first about free software and let them choose, maybe there is a chance that some of them will choose the free software.
