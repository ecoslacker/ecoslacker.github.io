##Welcome to the ecoslacker project

This is the new ecoslacker projects site, its aimed to create documentation and
entries about my software.

You can refer to my github.com repository to download and test any of my
programs if you find somthing interesting. Some of my programs are simple pieces 
of code that I've written since college, others are part of my work and there 
are programs that are part of my current research.

Please consider that I'm not a software engineer. Most of my programming
knowledge comes from self-learning.
