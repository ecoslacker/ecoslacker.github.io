Well here I am again, now I will start writing my adventures as a master student of agricultural engineering. In this blog I will be writting about programming and linux.

As a master student all my actions are focus on my research. Rigth now I'm studing about evolutionary computig to solve some hydraulic related problems. As an irrigation engineer I have a big interest in optimizing water distribution networks and evolutionary algorithms are excellent tools for this.

Greetings!
