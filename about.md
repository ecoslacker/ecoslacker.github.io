Irrigation Engineer from Chapingo University (Mexico).

I consider programming as my main hobby because I learned by myself. Currently I'm a master student of agricultural engineering. Yeah! Right? You may think that has nothing to do with programming or linux, but those are very useful tools for my profession and I like it. I have been using linux for some years now and it's my favorite OS.

I believe in the free culture that is why I started my way to become a hacker when I was younger. Now I identify myself as an enthusiast of projects like Free Software, Open Source, Wikipedia, GNU/Linux, Arduino, Raspberry Pi and many others. I have to make clear that I'm more attracted by the technical than the philosophical part of it.
