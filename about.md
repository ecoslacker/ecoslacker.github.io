I'm an irrigation engineer from Chapingo University (Mexico). I consider programming as my main hobby because I learned by myself. Currently I'm a master student of agricultural engineering.

I believe in the free culture that is why I started my way to become a hacker when I was younger. Now I identify myself as an enthusiast of projects like Free Software, Open Source, Wikipedia, GNU/Linux, Arduino, Raspberry Pi and many others. I have to make clear that I'm more attracted by the technical than the philosophical part of it.
